**<u><b>Partizan</b></u>** refers to a member of an armed group formed to fight secretly against an occupying force, often associated with resistance movements and guerrilla warfare. The term has its roots in the **Parthian Empire**, a powerful ancient civilization known for its strategic resistance and formidable warriors. The word embodies the spirit of independence, resistance, and resourcefulness.

# Partizan

Partizan is a robust security tool designed to streamline the detection of dangerous sinks, key terms, and source maps in web applications. Built with efficiency and ease of use in mind, it leverages Playwright to provide comprehensive scanning capabilities.

## Features

- **Dangerous Sinks Detection**: Automatically identifies and logs potentially dangerous code snippets.
- **Key-Terms Detection**: Detects specified keywords in page dependencies and logs them separately.
- **Source Maps Discovery**: Discovers and logs source maps for further analysis.
- **WAF ASCII Filtering Detection**: Identifies filtered ASCII characters by fuzzing query parameters in web requests and checking different encoding methods if a character is filtered.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Provides detailed logs of requests and responses.
- **Customizable Scans**: Easily configure and customize scans according to your needs.
- **Interested URLs List**: Generates a list of URLs of interest for detailed security checks.
- **Network Packet Analysis**: Logs, minimizes, and analyzes network packets to identify unique and potentially harmful requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Playwright
- `node-fetch`
- `prompt-sync`
- `string-similarity`

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dewebdes/partizan.git
cd partizan
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

Run the `browser.cjs` script:

```bash
node browser.cjs
```

Run the `packet-min.cjs` script:

```bash
node packet-min.cjs
```

Run the `waf-ascii.cjs` script:

```bash
node waf-ascii.cjs
```

Follow the prompts to input the hostname you want to analyze.

### Source Customization

You can customize the Partizan tool by setting specific paths and proxies. Here's how:

1. **Chrome Path**: To set the path for Chrome, use the following example:
   ```javascript
   const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
       executablePath: "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"
   });
   ```

2. **Proxy Configuration**: To configure a proxy, use the following example:
   ```javascript
   const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({
       args: ['--proxy-server=http://192.168.189.131:8080']
   });
   ```

For detailed guidance on proxy configuration, including cloud worker base proxies, you can refer to this [proxy-guide](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eyni-kave_aevagp-aewaeq-aetaevaezaetaepaeuaev-activity-7273419725672464384-Vs7e).

Feel free to modify these settings based on your specific requirements.

## File Descriptions

- **browser.cjs**: Handles the main browser automation tasks, including dangerous sink detection, key-terms detection, and source map discovery.
- **packet-min.cjs**: Focuses on processing and minimizing network packets for detailed analysis and security checks.
- **waf-ascii.cjs**: Detects filtered ASCII characters by fuzzing query parameters in web requests and checking different encoding methods if a character is filtered.

### packet-min.cjs

`packet-min.cjs` is designed for in-depth network packet analysis, focusing on processing and minimizing network packets to identify unique and potentially harmful requests.

#### Key Features:

- **Packet Logging**: Logs all HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses, capturing packet details for analysis.
- **Packet Minimization**: Analyzes logged packets to filter out duplicates and irrelevant data.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a detailed report of minimized packets, highlighting any suspicious activity.
- **Integration with browser.cjs**: Enhances the overall security analysis when used with `browser.cjs`.

#### Example Usage

```bash
node packet-min.cjs
```

### waf-ascii.cjs

`waf-ascii.cjs` is designed to detect filtered ASCII characters in web application firewalls (WAF) by fuzzing query parameters. It tests various encoding methods to identify which characters are filtered and logs detailed results.

#### Key Features:

- **Filtered ASCII Detection**: Identifies which ASCII characters are filtered by the WAF.
- **Encoding Tests**: Checks URL encoding, double URL encoding, and HTML encoding if a character is filtered.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides a detailed CSV report of filtered characters and their encoding results.

#### Example Usage

```bash
node waf-ascii.cjs
```
